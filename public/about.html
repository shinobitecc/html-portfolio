<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I'm a technology enthusiast who is endlessly curious and fascinated by how software, hardware, and systems come together to solve real problems. I enjoy exploring new tools and learning practical ways to turn ideas into working applications.</p>

<p>At over 40 years old and a parent of two, I'm starting an exciting journey into full‑stack web application development. I'm focused on building a solid foundation — from front-end interfaces to back-end services — so I can ship polished, useful products.</p>

<p>My dream is to launch multiple apps that serve the LATAM region — products that are localized, accessible, and solve everyday problems for people and businesses across the region.</p>

<p>Outside of code, I'm passionate about music production and performance. I play at my church and enjoy creating and arranging music, which keeps my creative side active and balanced with technical work.</p>

<p>I also love board games — they sharpen strategic thinking, spark great conversations, and are a favorite family pastime. I bring that same love of play and iteration into building software: prototype, test, improve.</p>

<p>If you'd like to connect about collaboration, music, or board games — or to see what I'm building — feel free to reach out.</p>
